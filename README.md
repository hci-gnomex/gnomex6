# GNomEx6

## Status 

Angular version is now running in production. We are working on making GNomEx 6 easier to install.  Look for those changes in early April. The adobe flex version of GNomEx can be found here: https://github.com/hci-gnomex/gnomex


## Description

GNomEx is genomic LIMS and data repository. It holds annotated experiments and downstream analysis and serves data tracks to popular genome browsers such as IGB, IGV, and UCSC genome browser. The LIMS handles all aspects of the experiment from order through results delivery including billing for services/consumables. Experiment platforms supported include Illumina HiSeq, MiSeq, iScan, ABI Sanger sequencing, Affy and Agilent Microarrays, Sequenom MassArray and Bioanalyzer.

GNomEx is a web application with a Flash client user interface and a Java backend that runs on Apache Tomcat. MySQL is used for the database, although any modern RDBMS can be used.

## Features
- Configurable for many different sequencing and experiment platforms
